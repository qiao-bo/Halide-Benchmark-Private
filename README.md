# Halide-Benchmark-Private
This repository contains sample commonly seen image processing applications implemented in [Halide](https://halide-lang.org/). We are mostly interested in the performance of Halide auto-schedulers described in [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2897824.2925952) on GPU backend. These are by no means expert implementations.
